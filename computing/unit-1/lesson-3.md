# Lesson 3

## Step 1
With everything you have learnt so far, can you code your agent to build a bridge across the water?   
The gap is 3 blocks wide.   
When done, press the **Play** button to compile the code, then go to the Minecraft world, press **T** and type **build_a_bridge**.

### ~ tutorialhint
Don't forget to place **down** when placing blocks!   
Also make sure your Agent has **building material** in its inventory. The blocks should be in **slot 1**.


```ghost
player.onChat("run", function () {
    player.say(":)")
    agent.teleportToPlayer()
    agent.turn(LEFT_TURN)
    agent.move(FORWARD, 1)
    agent.place(FORWARD)
})
```
